The gauss quadrature in specific uses Gauss points from the Legendre polynomials which enables it to used $q$ points to exactly solve any integrals with degree of up to $2q - 1$. It works on an interval $[-1, 1]$ meaning we have to change the interval to get results for a unit interval ($[0, 1]$). For a specifically 2-point Gauss Quadrature we can exactly solve up to cubic integrals, and for this we have to use the Gauss points $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$ and $-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$ together with the weights $w_0 = w_1 = 1$.\n",

We then run the function and get the average difference of 10 times for each amount of sample points, from $1$ to $300$ points. We then place this together with the expected convergence rate $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$ (where $n$ is the amount of points) to see if the function converges as expected. Looking at the results, we can clearly se that it does."
